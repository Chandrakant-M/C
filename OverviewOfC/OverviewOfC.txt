C:
The root of all modern languages is ALGOL(introduced in 1960s).
1967: Martin Richards developed BCPL(Basic Combined Progeamming Language) primarily for writing system software.
1970: Ken Thompson developed a language called B using many features of BCPL.Typeless system programming language.
1972: Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories developed C. The language derives from ALGOL,BCPL AND B.
UNIX coded almost entirely in C.
1989: ANSI C.
1990: ISO C.
1999: C99 by Standardization committee.

Basic structure of C programs. (Figure 1.9 Page 12 of the book)
Source code saved as .c files(eg. abc1.c).
gcc abc1.c
The above command translates the source program instructions into a form that is suitable for execution by the computer.
Translated program is stored on another file with the name abc1.o(.obj for MS-DOS) .This program is known as object code.
Linking is the process of putting together other program fies and functions that are required  by the program.For 
example, if the program is using exp() function,then the object  code of this function should be brought from the 
math library of the system and linked to the main program.Linker always assigns the same name a.out.
  The compiled and linked program is called the executable object code and is stored automatically in another file 
called a.out

gcc -c HelloWorld.c
	A C program is normally first compiled and then linked.But supplying -c option limits the process to just compilation.
Therefore just .o files is/are created(.obj in MS-DOS) having the same name as the source file name.

gcc HelloWorld.o
To link .o files explicitly(thereby creating a.out file),

gcc -c HelloWorld2.c HelloWorld2.c		To create .o files of multiple source files
gcc HelloWorld2.o HelloWorld2.o			To create SINGLE a.out from multiple .o files.Therefore, it is compulsory that 
										there be an exact SINGLE main() method
